                    <h3 class="center"> Hello Graduate Admission Officer!</h3>
                    <p class="center">Thank you for taking the time to look at my website. I appreciate you taking the care and diligence to check prospective students' backgrounds. My name is Tamzid Ahmad and I am on the road to becoming a software engineer. I have been putting in a great amount of work recently and I hope it shows. Over the years I have built up my resilience and now when I put my mind to something I wholeheartedly pursue it. I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript, on my own and am now pursuing certifications. I have created simple web applications and now I have built this website! Going through this journey has been incredibly satisfying and I believe the next step for me is to pursue a graduate education. Through graduate school I hope to meet like minded individuals and learn more about the software development process, industry standards, and the software business/industry in general. I hope that you take me into consideration for joining your program as I believe I would be a great fit for your community. Thank you again for taking the time to check out my website!
                      
                </br></br>Sincerely,
                        Tamzid Ahmad 

                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <p> P.S Some context for the photo. My most professional photo is the one on the homepage and as to not repeat the same one through linked in and the application and my site I wanted to include another photo for this page. This photo is from 2019 of me in bangladesh at a family friends wedding. I was told that Sal Khan from Khan Academy was supposed to be there and got super excited, but he didn't arrive. But one day, I hope to meet him, he is a hero!</p>
